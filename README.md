Label-prediction-in-advertisements
==================================

Feature vector : Dictionary of all the different words in label in the training data.
Training : Its somewhat close to calculating prior probalibity of every word in each category without normalizaion.
Distance metric used : Projection value (dot product)

User is recommended to install Anaconda 2.1.0 to have access to all the libraries used in the program. 
Program is taking approximately 5 minutes on my system configuration. Which is i5 processor with 8 GB ram.

Have fun and feel free to drop a query. I may not reply just the other day but I will trying to keep things as update as possible.

Any suggestion on improvement of code is invited.
